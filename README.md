Components:
Should have ONLY ONE top-level component (controller-view) that interacts with everything else 
	-this controller-view sets props on children 
	-interacts with flux stores 

Do not nest controller-views 

The HTML look-alike within react components is called JSX  

9/27 I only needed babel (installed through sublime palette and applied in view/syntax/open all with this extention/babel/javascript(babel))
